== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What changes for my customers? =

Besides the option that the CO2 compensation button provides, nothing changes. Your customers aren't troubled with registration or added steps - they just check out as always, regardless of whether they opted for CO2 compensation or not.

= Privacy considerations =

We gather as little data as possible, specifically:
- the WordPress admin email address, for sending invoices
- limited information about transactions with CO2 compensation selected (orderid, order total and compensation amount)
